# Notes Management CRUD Operations (MERN Stack)

# Description:

This is a simple Book Store Project built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) stack. This project demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on both the backend and frontend, including routing and CORS policy configuration.

# Features:
- __Backend CRUD:__ The backend of this project provides CRUD operations for managing notes. You can create, read, update, and delete notes using the API endpoints.
- __Backend Router:__ Express.js is used to set up the backend routing. Each CRUD operation has its own route and controller for clean code separation.
- __CORS Policy:__ Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy is configured to allow requests from the frontend to the backend, ensuring proper communication between the two.
- __MongoDB Operations:__ MongoDB is used as the database for storing book information. The backend performs database operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.
- __Frontend CRUD:__ The frontend of the project provides a user interface for performing CRUD operations on notes. You can add new notes, view existing notes, edit note details, and delete notes.
- __Frontend Router:__ React Router is used to create client-side routing, allowing seamless navigation between different pages of the frontend application.
